AI Tools Usage
	•	Which AI tools we used
	•	ChatGPT (OpenAI)
	•	How we used them
	•	We used ChatGPT to check that our HTML5 structure follows the requirements in the assignment PDF.
	•	We used it to improve the text content shown on the webpage (such as headings, paragraphs, and labels).
	•	ChatGPT helped us organize the assignment by dividing the work into tasks and creating a timeline for the team.
	•	We used ChatGPT to confirm that our HTML5 implementation meets the assignment specifications.
	•	ChatGPT supported us in writing and reviewing the report and in understanding the basics of Core Web Vitals performance analysis.
	•	What we learned from using these tools
	•	A clearer understanding of semantic HTML5 elements and how to use them correctly.
	•	Better planning and coordination within the team.
	•	Basic knowledge of Core Web Vitals and how to describe performance results.
	•	How to use AI tools for guidance while still completing the implementation ourselves.
	•	Confirmation
	•	We confirm that our team wrote and tested the full HTML5 implementation.
	•	We understand every part of the submitted work and can explain it without using any AI tools.
